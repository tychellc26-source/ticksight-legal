                <h3>Critical Investment Risks</h3>
                <p>All investments involve risk. Please carefully consider the following:</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-item">
                <h4>Market Risk</h4>
                <p>Stock prices fluctuate based on market conditions, economic factors, company performance, and investor sentiment. The value of any portfolio can decrease significantly.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-item">
                <h4>Loss of Principal</h4>
                <p>Investing in stocks and securities involves the risk of loss. You may lose some or all of your invested capital. There is no guarantee of returns or preservation of principal.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-item">
                <h4>Volatility Risk</h4>
                <p>Individual stocks and portfolios can experience significant short-term price fluctuations. Higher volatility means greater uncertainty in returns.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-item">
                <h4>Concentration Risk</h4>
                <p>Portfolios with limited diversification or heavy concentration in specific sectors, industries, or securities face increased risk if those holdings underperform.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-item">
                <h4>Systematic Risk</h4>
                <p>Market-wide factors (recession, interest rate changes, geopolitical events) can affect all securities simultaneously and cannot be eliminated through diversification.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-item">
                <h4>Benchmark Comparison Risk</h4>
                <p>Comparing portfolio performance to benchmarks does not guarantee similar future performance. Benchmarks may not reflect the same risk profile, composition, or investment objectives as user-created portfolios.</p>
